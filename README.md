Especially during the covid times, it was a lot of hassle for students to travel to their educational institutes and learn with hands-on experiences. Any institute or educational organization that is willing to conduct workshops or help students use their labs can create a post that will be displayed on the website so that any student can sign up and use it for learning purposes.
